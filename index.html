  <h1>What Is a “Document”?</h1>

  <p><em>Ordinarily the word “document” denotes a textual record. Increasingly sophisticated attempts to provide access to the rapidly growing quantity of available documents raised questions about what should be considered a “document.” The answer is important for any definition of the scope of Information Science. Paul Otlet and others developed a functional view of “document” and discussed whether, for example, sculpture, museum objects, and live animals, could be considered “documents.” Suzanne Briet equated “document” with organized physical evidence. These ideas appear to resemble notions of “material culture” in cultural anthropology and “object-as-sign” in semiotics. Others, especially in the U.S.A. (e.g., Jesse Shera and Louis Shores) took a narrower view. New digital technology renews old questions and also old confusions between medium, message, and meaning.</em></p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>What is a document? What could not be a document? Ordinarily information storage and retrieval systems have been concerned with text and text-like records (e.g., names, numbers, and alphanumeric codes). The present interest in “multimedia” reminds us that not all phenomena of interest in information science are textual or textlike. We may need to deal with any phenomena that someone may wish to observe: Events, processes, images, and objects as well as texts.</p>

  <p>This article reconstructs and comments on the development of thought on this topic with an emphasis on the ideas of continental European documentalists in the first half of this century. If “documentation” (a term that included information storage and retrieval systems) is what you do to or with documents, how far could you push the meaning of “document” and what were the limits to “documentation”? The work of European pioneers such as Paul Otlet and Suzanne Briet has received renewed attention in recent years and has been related to discussion of physical forms of “information”.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> These issues are important because mechanical information systems can only operate on physical representations of “information.” This background is relevant to the clarification of the nature and scope of information systems.</p>

  <h2>From Document to “Documentation”</h2>

  <p>In the late 19th century, there was increasing concern with the rapid increase in the number of publications, especially of scientific and technical literature. Continued effectiveness in the creation, dissemination, and utilization of recorded knowledge was seen as needing new techniques for managing the growing literature.</p>

  <p>The “managing” that was needed had several aspects. Efficient and reliable techniques were needed for collecting, preserving, organizing (arranging), representing (describing), selecting (retrieving), reproducing (copying), and disseminating documents. The traditional term for this activity was “bibliography.” However, “bibliography” was not entirely satisfactory for two reasons: (i) It was felt that something more than traditional “bibliography” was needed, e.g., techniques for reproducing documents; and (ii) “bibliography” also had other well-established meanings, especially historical (or analytical) bibliography, which is concerned with traditional techniques of book production.</p>

  <p>Early in the 20th century, the word “documentation” was increasingly adopted in Europe instead of “bibliography” to denote the set of techniques needed to manage this explosion of documents. Woledge (1983) provides a detailed account of the evolving usage of “documentation” and related words in English, French, and German. From about 1920, “documentation” was increasingly accepted as a general term to encompass bibliography, scholarly information services,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> records management, and archival work.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

  <p>There are numerous writings on the definition, scope, and nature of “documentation,” much of it concerned with the relationships between documentation, bibliography, and librarianship. Unfortunately, much of this literature, like much of the later discussion of information science and librarianship, is undermined by the authors’ attempts to create or amplify distinctions where the differences are not really fundamental but, rather, a matter of emphasis.</p>

  <p>Loosjes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> explained documentation in historical terms: Systematic access to written texts, he wrote, became more difficult after the invention of printing resulted in the proliferation of texts; scholars were increasingly obliged to delegate tasks to specialists; assembling and maintaining collections was the field of librarianship; bibliography was concerned with the descriptions of documents; the delegated task of creating access for scholars to the topical contents of documents, especially of parts within printed documents and without limitation to particular collections, was documentation.</p>

  <p>After about 1950, more elaborate terminology, such as “information science,” “information storage and retrieval,” and “information management,” increasing replaced the word “documentation.”</p>

  <h2>From Documentation Back to “Document”</h2>

  <p>The problems created by the increase in printed documents led to development of the techniques of documentation. However, the rise of documentation led, in turn, to a new and intriguing question that received little direct attention then or since.</p>

  <p>Documentation was a set of techniques developed to manage significant (or potentially significant) documents, meaning, in practice, printed texts. But there was (and is) no theoretical reason why documentation should be limited to texts, let alone printed texts. There are many other kinds of signifying objects in addition to printed texts. <strong>And if documentation can deal with texts that are not printed, could it not also deal with documents that are not texts at all?</strong> How extensively could documentation be applied? Stated differently, if the term “document” were used in a specialized meaning as the technical term to denote the objects to which the techniques of documentation could be applied, how far could the scope of documentation be extended. What could (or could not) be a document? The question was, however, rarely formulated in these terms.</p>

  <p>An early development was to extend the notion of document beyond written texts, a usage to be found in major English and French dictionaries.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> “Any expression of human thought” was a frequently used definition of “document” among documentalists. In the U.S.A., the phrases “the graphic record” and “the generic book” were widely used. This was convenient for extending the scope of the field to include pictures and other graphic and audio-visual materials. Paul Otlet (1868 – 1944), is known for his observation that documents could be three-dimensional, which enabled the inclusion of sculpture. From 1928, museum objects were likely to be included by documentalists within definitions of “document”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

  <p>The overwhelming practical concern of documentalists was with printed documents, so the question of how far the definition of “document” could be extended received little direct attention. Nevertheless, the occasional thoughtful writer would touch on the topic, perhaps because interested in some novel form of signifying object, such as educational toys, or because of a desire to generalize.</p>

  <h2>Paul Otlet: Objects as Documents</h2>

  <p>Otlet extended the definition of “document” halfway through his Traité de documentation of 1934. Graphic and written records are representations of ideas or of objects, he wrote, but the objects themselves can be regarded as “documents” if you are informed by observation of them. As examples of such “documents,” Otlet cites natural objects, artifacts, objects bearing traces of human activity (such as archaeological finds), explanatory models, educational games, and works of art.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>

  <p>In 1935, Walter Schürmeyer wrote: “Nowadays one understands as a document any material basis for extending our knowledge which is available for study or comparison”.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Similarly, the International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation, an agency of the League of Nations, developed, in collaboration with Union Français des Organismes de Documentation, technical definitions of “document” and related technical terms in English, French, and German versions and adopted:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Document:
      <ul>
        <li>Toute base de connaissance, fixée matériellement, susceptible d’être utilisée pour consultation, étude ou preuve. Exemples: manuscrits, imprimés, représentations graphiques ou figurés, objets de collections, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Document:
      <ul>
        <li>Any source of information, in material form, capable of being used for reference or study or as an authority. Examples: manuscripts, printed matter, illustrations, diagrams, museum specimens, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dokument:
      <ul>
        <li>Dokument is jeder Gegenstand, der zur Belehrung, zum Studium oder sur Beweisführung dienen kann, z.B. Handschriften, Drucke, graphische oder bildliche Darstellungen, usw.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Suzanne Briet: Physical Evidence as Document</h2>

  <p>One individual, who had, for years, been involved in discussions of the nature of documentation and documents, addressed the extension of the meaning of “document” with unusual directness. Suzanne Briet (1894–1989), also known as Suzanne Dupuy and as Suzanne Dupuy-Briet, was active as a librarian and documentalist from 1924 to 1954.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

  <p>In 1951, Briet published a manifesto on the nature of documentation, <em>Qu’est-ce que la documentation</em>, which starts with the assertion that “A document is evidence in support of a fact”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> She then elaborates: A document is “any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct, or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. The implication is that documentation should not be viewed as being concerned with texts but with access to evidence.</p>

  <h3>The Antelope as Document</h3>

  <p>Briet<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> enumerates six objects and asks if each is a document.</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Object</th>
        <th>Document?</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Star in sky</td>
        <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Photo of star</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stone in river</td>
        <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stone in museum</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Animal in wild</td>
        <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Animal in zoo</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>There is discussion of an antelope. An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document, she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Not only that, but scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

  <p>Briet’s rules for determining when an object has become a document are not made clear. We infer, however, from her discussion that:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>There is materiality: Physical objects and physical signs only;</li>
    <li>There is intentionality: It is intended that the object be treated as evidence;</li>
    <li>The objects have to be processed: They have to be made into documents; and, we think,</li>
    <li>There is a phenomenological position: The object is perceived to be a document.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This situation is reminiscent of discussions of how an image is made art by framing it as art. Did Briet mean that just as “art” is made art by “framing” (i.e., treating) it as art, so an object becomes a “document” when it is treated as a document, i.e., as a physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct, or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon? The sources of these views are not made clear, though she does mention, in this context, her friend Raymond Bayer, a professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne, who specialized in aesthetics and phenomenology.</p>

  <p>Ron Day<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> has suggested, very plausibly, that Briet’s use of the word “indice” is important, that it is indexicality—the quality of having been placed in an organized, meaningful relationship with other evidence—that gives an object its documentary status.</p>

  <h2>Donker Duyvis: A Spiritual Dimension to Documents</h2>

  <p>Frits Donker Duyvis (1894–1961), who succeeded Paul Otlet as the central figure in the International Federation for Documentation, epitomized the modernist mentality of the documentalists in his dedication to the trinity of scientific management, standardization, and bibliographic control as complementary and mutually reinforcing bases for achieving progress.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> Yet Donker Duyvis was not a materialist. He adopted Otlet’s view that a document was an expression of human thought, but he did so in terms of his interest in the work of Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925), founder of Anthroposophy, a spiritual movement based on the notion that there is a spiritual world comprehensible to pure thought and accessible only to the highest faculties of mental knowledge. As a result, Donker Duyvis was sensitive to what we might now call the cognitive aspects of the medium of the message. He wrote that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A document is the repository of an expressed thought. Consequently its contents have a spiritual character. The danger that blunt unification of the outer form exercises a repercussion on the contents in making the latter characterless and impersonal, is not illusory. . . . In standardizing the form and layout of documents it is necessary to restrict this activity to that which does not affect the spiritual contents and which serves to remove a really irrational variety.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Ranganathan: Micro-Thought on a Flat Surface</h2>

  <p>The Indian theorist S.R. Ranganathan, usually so metaphysical, took a curiously narrow and pragmatic position on the definition of “document,” resisting even the inclusion of audiovisual materials such as radio and television communications.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>But they are not documents; because they are not records on materials fit for handling or preservation. Statues, pieces of china, and the material exhibits in a museum were mentioned because they convey thought expressed in some way. But none of these is a document, since it is not a record on a more or less flat surface.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Ranganathan’s view of “document” as a synonym for “embodied micro thought” on paper “or other material, fit for physical handling, transport across space, and preservation through time” was adopted by the Indian Standards Institute (1963, p. 24), with a note explaining that the term “document” is now extended in use to include any embodied thought, micro or macro and whether the physical embodiment is exclusive to one work or is shared by more than one work.”</p>

  <p>Others, also, took a limited view of what documents were. In the U.S.A., two highly influential authors opted for a view of documents that was only an extension of textual records to include audiovisual communications. Louis Shores popularized the phrase “the generic book”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and Jesse H. Shera used “the graphic record” with much the same meaning.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Shera was gratuitously dismissive of Briet’s notion of documents as evidence.</p>

  <h2>Anthropology: Material Culture</h2>

  <p>Otlet was explicit that his view of “document” included archaeological finds, traces of human activity, and other objects not intended as communication.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Collections of objects brought together for purposes of preservation, science and education are essentially documentary in character (Museums and Cabinets, collections of models, specimens and samples). These collections are created from items occurring in nature rather than being delineated or described in words; they are three dimensional documents.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The notion of objects as documents resembles the notion of “material culture” among cultural anthropologists “for whom artifacts contributed important evidence in the documentation and interpretation of the American experience” (Ames et al., 1985, p. ix) and in museology.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>

  <h2>Semiotics: “Text” and “Object-as-Sign”</h2>

  <p>Briet’s ideas concerning the nature of a “document” invite discussion in relation to semiotics. In this context, we note Dufrenne’s discussion of the distinction between aesthetic objects and signifying objects:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The function of such [signifying] objects is not to subserve some action or to satisfy some need but to dispense knowledge. We can, of course, call all objects signifying in some sense. However, we must single out those objects which do more than signify merely in order to prepare us for some action and which are not used up merely in the fulfillment of the task. Scientific texts, catechisms, photograph albums, and, on a more modest scale, signposts are all signs whose signification engages us in an activity only after having first furnished us with information.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We can observe that by the inclusion of museum and other “found” objects, Briet’s “any physical or symbolic sign” appears to include both human signs and natural signs. Others developed the notion of “object-as-sign.” Roland Barthes, for example, in discussing “the semantics of the object,” wrote that objects</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>function as the vehicle of meaning: in other words, the object effectively serves some purpose, but it also serves to communicate information: we might sum it up by saying that there is always a meaning which overflows the object’s use.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We can note the widespread use of the word “text” to characterize patterns of social phenomena not made of words or numerals, but there seems to have been relatively little attention to the overlap between semiotics and information science.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>

  <h2>Comments</h2>

  <p>One difference between the views of the documentalists discussed above and contemporary views is the emphasis that would now be placed on the social construction of meaning, on the viewer’s perception of the significance and evidential character of documents. “Relevance,” a central concept in information retrieval studies, is now generally considered to be situational and ascribed by the viewer. In semiotic terminology,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>signs are never natural objects. . . . The reason is simply that the property of being a sign is not a natural property that can be searched for and found, but a property that is given to objects, be they natural or artificial, through the kind of use that is made of them. Both as objects and as means, signs have to be treated as something invented, and in this sense they are correlated to actions.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Briet’s notion of documents as evidence can occur in at least two ways. One purpose of information systems is to store and maintain access to whatever evidence has been cited as evidence of some assertion. Another approach is for the person in a position to organize artifacts, samples, specimens, texts, or other objects to consider what each could tell one about the world that produced it, and then, having developed some theory of its significance to place the object <em>in evidence</em>, to offer it as evidence by the way it is arranged, indexed, or presented. In this manner, information systems can be used not only in finding material that already is in evidence, but also in arranging material so that someone may be able to make use of it as (new) evidence for some purpose.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>

  <p>The evolving notion of “document” among Otlet, Briet, Schurmeyer, and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. Levy’s thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, but so does everything else in a digital environment. In this sense, any distinctiveness of a document as a physical form is further diminished, and discussion of “What is a digital document?” becomes even more problematic unless we remember the path of reasoning underlying the largely forgotten discussions of Otlet’s objects and Briet’s antelope.</p>

  <h2>Postscript: Documenting the Antelope</h2>

  <p>Briet’s discussion of an antelope as a document is quite specific: The antelope was from Africa; it was a newly discovered species; and it was brought to the Jardin des Plantes of the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Her account reads as if she were referring to an actual antelope known to her. In 1947, not long before Briet’s book appeared, the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle did announce the discovery of a new African antelope—<em>Tragelaphus scriptus reidae</em>, a subspecies of bushbuck — but there is no indication that a specimen was taken to Paris.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> The documentation of antelopes reveals that very few new species were discovered during Briet’s lifetime and documentary evidence of Briet’s antelope has eluded us. Appropriately, the word “antelope” itself, we found, is thought by some to derive from the Ethiopian word for the elusive unicorn.</p>

<h2 class="article1"> Why Are We So Obsessed With “Ugly” Shoes? 
  Psychologists Weigh In</h2>

    <p class="page2-1">
      After depriving myself of any opportunity to spend money on things that weren’t absolutely necessary for about a year, I finally decided to break my “nothing new” shopping approachand purchase the absolute ugliest pair of Crocs I could find: Realtree Baes, a platform version of the brand’s traditional clog covered in camo print. They arrived at my door a week later, and I haven’t taken them off since.

      I’m certainly not alone in my newfound love of “ugly” footwear. While many people scoff at some of the latest shoe styles — Bottega Veneta’s Puddle Boots, Christopher Kane’s Z-Coil sandal, Balenciaga’s many styles of Crocs, etc. — many more are taking out their credit cards. 
      “Ugly fashion attracts attention because it is different,” explains Carolyn Mair, Ph.D., a cognitive psychologist who specializes in fashion. We tend to ignore “normal” or average objects since we know how to process them, she says, but we pay more attention to complex or unusual objects — ugly shoes included.
      
      Iterations of conventionally unattractive shoes have been making waves in fashion for years. Christopher Kane debuted Crocs for his Spring 2017 runway collection back in September 2016, followed a year later by the firstBalenciaga x Crocs collaboration in October 2017. Dad sneakers (or grandpa sneakers) have risen in popularity in the street style circuit, with shoes like the Fila Disruptor and Balenciaga Triple S becoming cult favorites amongst fashion’s elite. And let us not forget we’ve entered the Golden Age of clogs, with many designers putting their own spin on the clunky footwear that was once the province of Dutch field workers and Brooklyn moms.

      Iterations of conventionally unattractive shoes have been making waves in fashion for years. Christopher Kane debuted Crocs for his Spring 2017 runway collection back in September 2016, followed a year later by the firstBalenciaga x Crocs collaboration in October 2017. Dad sneakers (or grandpa sneakers) have risen in popularity in the street style circuit, with shoes like the Fila Disruptor and Balenciaga Triple S becoming cult favorites amongst fashion’s elite. And let us not forget we’ve entered the Golden Age of clogs, with many designers putting their own spin on the clunky footwear that was once the province of Dutch field workers and Brooklyn moms.

A year-plus of social distancing and time spent at home due to a global pandemic has only given further rise to the popularity of ugly-yet-comfy footwear. While going out was no longer a thing, we ditched high heels for easier-to-wear styles for our masked-up trips to the grocery store. According to shopping app Klarna, there’s been an 872% increase in searches for “Crocs” since last June, and a 391% increase in searches for “clogs.”

As far as fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen is concerned, the dearth of social interactions since early 2020 has us looking to our wardrobes to help us engage more than ever. Wearing something that may be considered a conversation piece is a way to connect. “If you and I have been indoors, and we haven’t had in-person interactions, going outdoors and wearing ugly footwear like the [Balenciaga] Croc stiletto will cause people to look at our feet, and they will begin to engage us,” she says. “Then we’ve gained our social points for the day.”
    </p>

    <p class="page3-1">
      Even as the world begins to open back up and many of our lives return to some sense of normalcy, ugly footwear shows no signs of slowing down. Remember Isabel Marant’s iconic Bekett sneaker from the early 2010s (which some refer to as the OG ugly footwear)? It's back and will cost you a cool $770 per pair today. Birkenstocks and Tevas are also enjoying an extended moment of glory, thanks to designer team-ups. But while there’s no denying that we’ve become pretty obsessed with heinous shoes, the question is why? Novelty alone is not enough to explain the fact that Italian label Avavav's unseemly finger feet boots are almost entirely sold out.

According to Dr. Matt Johnson, founder of consumer psychology blog PopNeuro and host of the neuroscience and marketing training program Neuromarketing Bootcamp, the answer comes from the ways our choice of footwear can affect us on a deeper level. “The brands we buy and the clothes we wear have a deep impact on our mood and our behavior,” he says. “Some of this comes down to the item of clothing itself: how it feels on us, and how we think of ourselves while wearing it. 
    </p>

    <p class="page3-2">
      We come to associate specific moods and mental states with specific items, so much so that when we put them on, we’re instantly transported into that state.”

Dr. Mair adds that this tendency to invest a garment with greater meaning is known as "essentialism," or “an intangible property that makes an item unique.” In the case of clunky, bulbous styles like clogs, she says that some may believe them to send out a more welcoming message to others: “We tend to interpret round, curved shapes as soft, warm, and approachable, and jagged shapes as hard, cold, and potentially dangerous.”

So is ugly footwear here to stay? According to the experts, it is. Dr. Johnson mentions that throughout the pandemic, we’ve grown accustomed to the comfort of spending time at home — and the comfortable, ugly shoes that come with that. As life begins its slow return to normal, a few nostalgists may be excitedly dusting off their towering heels, but many of us will never look back.“While people will ultimately ditch the sweatpants as they begin to head out into the world, the emphasis on comfort will likely remain,” Dr. Johnson says. “This may mean that traditionally uncomfortable heels may give way to more comfortable competitors.”

<p class="page5-1">
  However, if it were only about comfort, we’d all be laced into matching Adidas Boosts. The instinct toward the ugly “comes back to differentiation,” Dr. Johnson adds. “People don’t want to just look good, they also, crucially, want to look different.” Crocs fit that bill, but they also fit another even more narrow category of items: So uncool that they’re cool.

“It’s a confidence move to wear Crocs, as if saying, ‘I’m so cool that I can wear these ugly shoes and still be cool.’ Or better yet, ‘I’m so cool, I can make Crocs look cool, ’” posits Dr. Johnson. That stands even when there are multiple versions storming up and down the block. Though, as Dr. Karen adds, once enough other people start adopting the “ugly shoe,” it starts to shed its irony and become “pretty.”
Whether you’re a lover or a hater, a comfort seeker or an ironic flag-waver, the ugly shoe will likely continue to grace runways, streets, and our social feeds for seasons to come. If you’ve been contemplating buying a pair of your own, there’s no better time to dip a toe in. May I suggest Crocs?

UGLY SHOES ARE BACK, BABY!
</h2>

<img class="shoe13" src="images/17591062_36597281_1000.png" alt="turquoiseshoes">

<p class="page10-1">“Ugly” shoes have been buzzy for a few years now, and here at SELF, we’re not mad about it. As it turns out, this is one shoe trend that's surprisingly great for your feet. It started with high-fashion designer Balenciaga’s “dad sneakers” and its collaboration with Crocs, and was followed by Bottega Veneta’s iconic puddle booties. With an influx of TikTok influencers now touting more affordable options from brands like Hoka, Dansko, Ugg, and Birkenstock, the trend doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

  With “ugly” shoes, minimalist silhouettes and clean lines are replaced with chunky accents, sky-high platforms, and comfort-first design. You’ll also find traditional orthopedic clogs, “gorpcore” hiking shoes, wool slippers, and “crunchy" sandals that make you look like you probably spent your weekend making your own granola.
  
  The unique designs and generally high levels of support make ugly shoes not only a worthwhile investment for your closet, but also for your feet. If you have plantar fasciitis, bunions, flat feet, or just generally tired soles, you’ve probably been in on this “trend” for a while.</p>

  UGLY SHOES ARE HERE TO STAY, THANKS TO COMFORTABILITY
</h2>

<p class="page13-1">
  There has never been a trend quite like the ugly shoes. Gaining popularity in late 2016 with Christopher Kane’s Crocs collaboration, this anti-aesthetic approach didn’t look like it was going to be here for the long run (pardon the pun). But the release of Balenciaga’s Triple S sneaker in 2017, followed by the arrival of this summer’s must-have Dad sandals, suggests that this ironic take on our beloved fathers’ shoe wardrobe is here to stay. We’re not surprised: If 2020 was going to be any type of shoe, wouldn’t it be an ugly one?
To see this trend in motion, look no further than the runways. Molly Goddard called on UGG to create vibrant platform mules, fuzzy slippers, and embroidered boots to punctuate her spring-summer 2021 collection of bright and playful silhouettes, all of which could easily satisfy comfort cravings. The clogs brand Crocs has also done a series of collaborations this year, one involving Justin Bieber. More recently it joined forces with Grateful Dead x Chinatown Market to create a tie-dye iteration of the clog shoe. 
</p>

<p class="page13-2">
  According to The Lyst Index, the shoe generated a virtual queue of over 45,000 people on launch day, putting the collab in ninth position for the hottest women’s products. Need more encouragement? Look to Rihanna, who was recently photographed wearing the Balenciaga x Vibram five-finger boots. 

  With the Covid-19 pandemic still shaping our lives, dressing for comfort first is of utmost importance: another factor that sees the ugly shoes trend gaining momentum. Because they’re designed to be comfortable, ugly shoes give us a much-needed break from the customary blister-inducing black boots of winter.

<p class="page15-1">
  Scared of what your neighbors may think? Try this trend indoors first. In fact, we encourage it. As described by Dr. Vanessa Barrow, our homebound lifestyles have led to a decrease in wearing shoes around the house. In turn it has caused an uptick in “Flintstone feet,” a condition where ligaments stretch and arches fall, reducing our ability to wear shoes. As a preventive measure, we recommend supportive (but super fun) sneakers or our editor’s choice of Birkenstocks. Whether you stay in the house or dance with your Bottega Veneta puddle boots in the rain for all to see, check out our top ugly (and comfortable) shoes below.
